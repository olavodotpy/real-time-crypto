                    <p>Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner;</p>
                    <p>while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible.</p>
                    <p>Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value.</p>
                    <p>Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.</p>
                    <p>Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas.</p>
                    <p>In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract.</p>
                    <p>The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation.</p>
                    <p>Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand.</p>
